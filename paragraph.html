        Java</h1>
    <p>
        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
        implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
        programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
        that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to
        bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
        The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java
        runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically
        not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming
        languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a
        reported 9 million developers.[21]

    <p>
        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
        ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
        curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        <p>

        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of
        websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] Most web
        browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>

       <p> As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
        It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard
        data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
